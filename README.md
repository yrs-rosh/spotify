# spotify

A simple Spotify UI designed using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

Javascript is not used.


Have started this project to test my profeciency in Responsive Web Design.
Tried to make it responsive as much as I can but it needs to be more responsive.

Have a look over it https://yrs-rosh.github.io/spotify/
and suggest some edits.

contributors are always welcome.

Have a nice day.../>
